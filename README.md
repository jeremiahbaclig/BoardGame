# BoardGame
Unsure of what to call this board game. Work in progress. 

NOTES: 9x9? grid with 2 rows of “pawns”. Plans to add 3 levels of cpu using Minimax with Alpha–beta pruning. Center box (maybe a random spot on the middle row?) has promotion "item". Every 5 rounds you choose which piece to promote. Once promoted, pieces move 2 spaces and can also capture using hops. Double promotion if no other pieces left to promote on a 5 turn. Can only have one double promote but you can switch on 5 turns which to double promote. 

Win condition: first to double promote AND have more pieces than the other person.
